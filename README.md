# DAO Vibe: AI-Powered DAO Management Platform
This repository contains my project submission for the **CodeNut Global Vibe: AI Web3 Hackathon 2025**. "DAO Vibe" is a full-stack, end-to-end decentralized application designed to abstract the complexity of creating and managing Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs).
The core mission of this project is to democratize on-chain governance by enabling non-technical users to deploy and manage a complete DAO framework through a simple, conversational user interface.

### Project Overview & Key Features
DAO Vibe is a complete platform for DAO lifecycle management, from an initial idea to a functioning on-chain organization.
* **AI-Powered DAO Generation:** A guided, multi-step wizard that translates natural language inputs (e.g., DAO name, tokenomics, governance rules) into a set of secure, interoperable smart contracts.
* **One-Click Contract Deployment:** The AI backend generates and deploys a complete, three-contract system (`Governor`, `GovernanceToken`, `Treasury`) to the blockchain, all initiated from a single user transaction.
* **Full Governance Dashboard:** A comprehensive management interface where users can view created DAOs, submit new governance proposals, and securely cast votes on active proposals.

### Key Technical Achievements

This project was built to demonstrate the advanced capabilities of the CodeNut platform for complex Web3 development.

* **DAO Factory Pattern:** Implemented a robust "DAO Factory" smart contract that serves as a single, trusted entry point for deploying new, sandboxed DAO systems.
* **100% Test Coverage:** The CodeNut AI generated a comprehensive test suite of 26 tests, achieving 100% test coverage on the smart contract backend, ensuring reliability and security.
* **AI-Driven Full-Stack Development:** The entire application, from the React-based frontend UI to the complex Solidity backend and web3.js integration, was generated and iterated upon using CodeNut's "Vibe Coding" AI agents.
